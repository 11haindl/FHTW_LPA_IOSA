## Description

My Day is a combination of Diray and Logbook. 

You can create Log-Entries with a title and a content where you describe what is happening right now. Additionally you can add a picture from your photos library or if you want you can make a voice recording.

All your Entries are shown in a list overview. When clicking on a list item you can see all the details of the selected Entry.
